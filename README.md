# Ticketify

## Introduction
Ticketify is a blockchain-based ticketing system that leverages NFT (Non-Fungible Token) technology to create a secure, transparent, and tamper-proof solution for event ticketing. Built using Solidity and smart contracts, Ticketify eliminates fraud, scalping, and counterfeit tickets while enabling a decentralized ticketing experience.

## How Ticketify Works
Ticketify utilizes an ERC721-based smart contract to manage ticket ownership and transfers. The main mechanism includes:

1. *Minting Tickets as NFTs*: Each ticket is minted as an NFT with unique metadata, ensuring authenticity and security.
2. *Claiming and Purchasing Tickets*: Users can claim or buy tickets by sending the required amount of ETH to the smart contract.
3. *Seat Allocation and Booking*: Each ticket is associated with a specific seat number, preventing duplicate bookings.
4. *Secondary Sales & Resale Cap*: Ticket owners can list their tickets for resale, with a maximum price cap to prevent extreme markups.
5. *Secure Ownership & Transfers*: Transfers are securely handled within the blockchain, ensuring a transparent transaction history.
6. *Expiration Mechanism*: Event organizers can mark tickets as expired post-event, preventing reuse.

## Problems Solved by Ticketify

1. *Eliminates Counterfeit Tickets*: Every ticket is a unique NFT, ensuring authenticity and preventing duplication.
2. *Prevents Scalping & Price Gouging*: By enforcing a maximum resale price, Ticketify protects buyers from unfair pricing.
3. *Enhances Transparency*: All transactions are recorded on the blockchain, ensuring a fully traceable ticketing system.
4. *Immutable & Secure Ownership*: Ticket owners have verifiable proof of ownership via blockchain technology.
5. *Decentralized Control*: No intermediaries are required, reducing costs and increasing efficiency for event organizers and buyers.
6. *Automated Revenue Distribution*: Event organizers automatically receive payments, removing the need for third-party payment processors.
7. *Easy Transferability*: Ticket holders can securely sell or transfer their tickets without the risk of fraud.
8. *Efficient Event Management*: Organizers can track ticket sales, verify attendees, and manage seating without manual intervention.

Ticketify revolutionizes the event ticketing industry by bringing transparency, security, and efficiency through blockchain technology.
